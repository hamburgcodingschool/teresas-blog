Founding is especially hard as an introvert. Things like business meetings, pitching and networking events cause mental stress. As introvert and freshly baked entrepreneur I had to find a way to make business easier for me, that I want to share with you here.

Founding is hard, I think everyone who ever founded a company will agree on that. But founding is especially hard if you are an introvert. Because as a founder, certain activities will become part of your dayly life that are far outside of your comfort zone: things like business meetings, meetings strangers, networking events, pitching or selling. 

As an introvert, these activities cause an extra amount of mental stress. They make you feel stressed, overwhelmed, and anxious. They might also make you feel like a fraud, like you just pretend that you know what you are doing, or that you pretend that what you are offering is actually valuable. This is commonly referred to as *imposter syndrome*.

I am a software developer and a founder, and I'm also an introvert. These things do make me feel stressed, anxious, and cause imposter syndrome. At times, I felt horrible, I felt burned out and I didn't want to continue anymore. But I didn't quit.

Instead, I went to a mental health clinic where they treat burnout patients, and got a first interview. I told them my story, that I founded a business, and now I feel burnt out. And they basically sent me back home.

They said, being an entrepreneur is hard, you have a lot of things to do, and for the first year it is normal to feel stressed and overwhelmed, and it's not necessarily a sign of a mental health problem. They told me to come back in a couple of months or half a year, should this feeling persist or get worse.

So when I didn't get any help from the professionals, I decided I will help myself. I bought a lot of books, mainly on psychology and burnout syndrome, and read one after the other. I listened to a podcast called [Hiding in the Bathroom](https://www.forbes.com/podcasts/hiding-in-the-bathroom/), which is a podcast for women entrepreneurs who are also introverts‚ÄìI truly recommend it.

And I also bought some books on marketing. Because doing marketing for my business was now also part of my job, and as a Master of Science in software engineering, this was something I really didn't know much about, and I needed to read up on it.

One of the marketing books that I read was [The 1-Page Marketing Plan](https://www.amazon.com/1-Page-Marketing-Plan-Customers-Money-ebook/dp/B01B35M3SM) by Allan Dib. And in his book he said something that was like an epiphany to me. He said:

> If you‚Äôre a sole operator or a small business, it‚Äôs not a problem if you currently perform all or most of the roles in your business. But it is a problem if you currently **have to** perform all the roles in your business. If you are indispensable, you are a bottleneck and the business will only move as fast as you can.

You are your companies bottleneck, because there are only 24 hours a day, and you can work only so many hours a day. This doesn't scale‚Äìif you want your business to scale, you eventually have to hire people. So in simple English, he basically said:

> **Don't do it alone, get a team!**

He explained in greater detail why that is, very business-y reasons like exit strategy or building a frenchise. But what really stroke me was that the books about psychology and burnout basically said the same: *Don't isolate yourself, but nurnurte meaningful human relationships, especially at work!*

The psychology behin it is this: As humans, we are social creatures. We need a clan, a tribe, a social group that we belong to. If we don't have that at work‚Äìthe place where we spent the majority of our waking hours‚Äìwe will feel lonely, depressed, or even anxious.

In the same way it is also normal that, in a situation where you are facing a group of people who are *not* your tribe (like a networking event), you might feel a bit anxious. This is especially true for introverts.

So I changed some things. I got a mentor whom I meet on a biweekly basis, and I hired Stine as my assistant, as the first step in the direction of making myself redundant in my company.

With her, I have someone now that I can share my thoughts with, someone that I can go to for a second opinion, who supports me and whom I support. And I also get some help with marketing. üòÅ

Now that I have a team, I feel less stressed, I feel less anxious in business meetings or networking events, and I don't struggle with imposter syndrome anymore. Because now, all the things that I am doing, I don't do them out of selfish reasons (like money) anymore, but I am rather doing it for the team. The team that I am a part of, that I belong to. And this is a much more rewarding feeling.
